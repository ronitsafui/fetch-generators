This is a ES6 Generators + Fetch API demo application. It uses babel to transpile ES6 to ES5.

To be able run the sample, you should have Node.js installed and gulp package installed globally. Once you have installed these, you can run the sample by executing the following commands from a terminal in the project's root directory:

  - npm install
  - gulp

This command starts a Node.js server on port 8000. Now open a browser and change URL to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the application.
